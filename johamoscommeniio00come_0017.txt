Schools suppose they have already learn²d it at the English3 part-
ly, because our common Grammar is too much defhc‘live in this
„ part, and Scholars so little exercised therein‚ that they pass
from Schools to the Univetfities, and return from thence (some
of them) more unable to write true English, than either Latin
or Greek. Not to speak of our ordinary Tradesmen‚ many of
whom write such false English, that none but themselves can in·

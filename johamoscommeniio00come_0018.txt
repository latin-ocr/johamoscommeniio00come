have heen remedied in this T ranstati‘on3 that the Book being writ
1'n high-Dutch doth express many things 'in reference to that Coun-
ἵν] and Speech which cannot without alteration offhme Pitlures
ds wellas words be expreffed in ours: for the Symbolical Α-Ῑ·
,Ρὴεὸεῑ is fitted for German children rather than fhr ours.
,And whereas the words of that Language go orderly one for one
with the Latin, our English propriety ofSpeech will not admit
the like. Therefiire it will behove those Maflers that intend “
to make use of this Book, to construe it verbatim to, their young
Scholars‚ who will quickly learn to do it of themselves, after
they be once acquainted with the'first words ofNonns, and V erbs
and their manner of variatim,

Such a work as this, Ι ohserve to have been formerly much
defired by firme experienced T eaelum, and Ι my self’liad some
years fince (whilst my onon child lived) hegun the like, having
found it most agreeable to the best witted children, who are
most taken up¹ with Piftures from their Infancy‚ because
by them the knowledge of things which they stem to re-
present (and whereof children are ns yet ignorant) are most
eafily conveyed to their understanding. But sor as much

’ ,as the work is now done (though in some things not so compleat-

ly as it were to he wished) Ι rejoyce in the use of it, and defist
Vin my own undertakingsfor the present. And because any good
¹thing is the better, being the more communicated ς Ι have
herein imitated a Child who is forward to impart to others what
himlelfhath well liked. You then that have the care of little

' Children, do not much trouble their thoughts and clog their

, memories with bare Grammar Rudiments‚ which to them are
harfh in getting, and fluid in retaining3 because indeed to 3
them they signifie nothing ‚ but a mere swimming notion of (z ¹
general term, which they know not what it maneth, till they
comprehend also particulars, but by this or the likesubfidhzry,
inform them ‚' first with some knowledge of things and words
where-with to express them, and then their Rules of speaking
will be better understood and more firmly kept in mind. Else

“ how should a Child conceive what a Rule maneth, when he
neither knoweth what the Latin word importeth, nor what

³ manner of thing it is which is fignified to him in his own native

Language, which is given him thereby to understand the Rule?

For Rules confiliing of generalities‚ are delivered (as I may

fay) at a third hand, 'presuming first the things, and then the

‚words to be already apprehended touching which they ar} chlei'

mar only at the first, do puzzle their imaginations with ·
abstrastive terms and secundary intentions, which till they

be spmewhat acquainred with things», and the words belong· ,
ing to them, in the Language which they learn, they can« ⁷ ,
not apprehend what they mean. And thu I guess to be the*
reason, why many greater persons do resolve sometimes· not to put

a Child to School ‘till he be at least eleven or twelve years of
age, presuming that he having then taken notice os moll things,
will sooner get the knowledge of the words which are appljed ⁷
to them in any Language. But the gross mifdemeanour ofsuch
children for the most part, have taught many Parents to be
hasty enough to send their own to School3 if not that they may ‘¹
learn, stt (ac least) that they might be kept outofharms way;
andyet isthey do not profitfin· the time they have been at School‚

(no respea‘l a? all being had of their years) the Master fhall be
sure enough to bear the blame. κ

So that a School-mzsler had need to bend his wits to come
within the compass of a Child‘s-capacify offix or seven years'of
age (seeing we have now such commonly brought to our Gram-
mar-schools to learn the Latin—TongueN and to make that th'ey

. -may learn with as much delight and willingness, as himself
would teach with dexterity and ease. And at present l know ι
no better help to fhrward hu young Scholnrs than this little

, Book, which was for thu purpose contrived by the Author in the

-’ ‘German and Latin Tongues.

What profitable use may he had thereos, resrec‘ling chiefly that
his own Counrry and Language, he himjelf huth told you in his
Preface3 but what use we may here make of it in our Gram-

’ mar-Schools‚ as it u now transsated into English, I fhall part-

* ly declare3 leaving all other men (according to my wont), to*
their own discretion and liberty, to use it or refuse it, as they
pleafie. So loon then as a child can read English perfemy
and is brought us to School to learn Latin, I would have him
together with his Accidence, to be provided of thu Book, in
which he may at least once a day (hefia'es his Accidence) 'be
thus exercijed. ’ψ π

’ tles or Inscriptions‚ till hehe ableto turn readily to any one of
them, and to tell its nome either in English or Latin. By this ,
me ms he (hall have the merhod ofthex Book in his Hend 3 and
be eafily fiirnijhed with the knowledge of mos} things3 and
instruam how to call them, when at any time he meeteth with

„Q them elsewhere, intheir real forms. 11. Lu>
